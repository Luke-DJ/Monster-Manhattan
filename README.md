# Monster Manhattan

Monster Manhattan is the result of the second game jam during my second year of University.  
My team consisted of four designers and two programmers, and the game jam lasted four and a half days.  
My contribution mainly consisted of the mobile-specific elements (e.g. input, stress-testing on multiple devices), optimized baked-lighting setup for prefabs, spawning/despawning & moving scene objects, UI, and animation control.
A full breakdown of my work during the game jam can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rHSQfhOveiJ1pYB36WROPP3nDyWpT9nfx-c_QIptU44/view" target="_blank">here</a> on page 24 (my contributions to this document are written in green text).
